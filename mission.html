                <p>In the United States alone known adverse drug interactions cause death, injury or hospitalization to more than 2 million people yearly, and this could be the tip of the iceberg as millions of cases go undetected or unreported.

This device immediately engages readers and, by encouraging them to look with him for a solution to the problem presented, gives them a quick, practical understanding of the subject.   </p>
